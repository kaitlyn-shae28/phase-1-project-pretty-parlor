## General Information
The Pretty Parlor is a web application that was created to make book an appoinment for the Pretty Parlor more accessible to the salon's clientele. In doing so, this may bring on a wider range of clients to the salon and grow its business.

## Features
This app includes a list of cards each showcasing a different service which the salon provides. The cards have an image representing the service, the service title, the base price of the service, and a button which books an appointment when clicked.

The Pretty Parlor web page also includes a filter at the top of the page. This filter gives a user the ability to narrow down the service they may be searching for between a *hair appointment* or a *nail appointment*. This allows for easier accessability for users.
